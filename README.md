This project is an app made in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which, through and API, show random question whit the possible answer options.
At first it shows the main menu where you can chose between start the game, or see the high scores saved in the app. When you start the game, the interface shows the HUB where you can see your score, the number of the question, and a bar that simulate your progress. At the end the app allows you to save your score (if it is high enough it will appear in the high scores tab), play again, or to go to the home page.
